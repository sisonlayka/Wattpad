    <br/> <font size="5"> I have been awaiting a phone call for a month, and when my phone finally rings I smile answer and say " Hey!" <br/>

   <br/> "Hey. I've missed you, "he says. and I can tell he's smiling. <br/>

    <br/> "I've missed you too. How is it over there?" I ask feeling  my heart explode with happiness. <br/>

    <br/> "It's quite nice when the bombs and guns aren't going off. How's college?" he asks<br/>

    <br/> It's going well. Matt, when are you coming home." I ask. <br/>

    <br/> I should be home in a few months, sweetheart, he says. "  have to go. Iloveyou" <br/>

    <br/> Thats when I herar the gun fire and I with worry sadness in my voices. "Bye" drop by my head tino my hands. I begin praying and crying hoping he'll come home. <br/> </font>
