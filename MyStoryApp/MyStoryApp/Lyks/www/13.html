    <p> <font size= "5"> He died </p>

    <div>

    <br/> <font size="5"> A girl and a boy were spending over 100mph on a motorcycle. <br/>

    <br/> The girl worriedly said, <i> "Slow down, I'm scared." </i> <br/>

    <br/> The guy replied, <i> "No, this is fun." </i> <br/>

    <br/>The girl was scared she then shouted, <i> "No! It is not, please ... its so scary!" </i> <br/>

    <br/> The boy smiled sweetly and said, <i> "The tell me you love me and give me a big tight hug" </i> <br/>
>
   <br/>Then the girl took a deep breath and sincerely said, <i> "ILOVEYOU" </i> and give him  big hug <br/>

    <br/> The guy suddenly asked, <i> Can you take my helmet off ang put it on? " </i> <br/>

    <br/> The next day in the newspaper, a motorcycle crashed into a building due to brake failure, 2 people were in the crash.<br/>

    <br/> But only ONE survived. <br/>
    

    <br/>The truth was the halfway down the road the guy realized that the breaks weren't working, but he didn't want the girl to know. Instead, he asked the girl to tell him she loves him and had her hug one last time. Then he asked her to put his helmet on so that she would live even if it meant that he would die.. <br/> </font>
