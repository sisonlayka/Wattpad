    <br/><font size="5">I heard a good news. <br/>
    <br/> At first, I was excited and happy but I was afraid. It was the only good thing I heard first time in a very long time. I was afraid that it was not true. <br/>
    <br/> I was afraid that even if's not that good, it's good to be true. I was afraid it was like the other things that disguises themselves as a good things to make you hope. I was afraid that it was just a lie. I was afraid of getting hurt over that. <br/>

    <br/>  So many what if's that it  made me forget to calm down. The feelings are all jumped up. My stomach's in butterflies because I was so happy but I felt like puking becaue of the what if's that pop up in my head that gave me anxiety.. <br/> </font> </center>
