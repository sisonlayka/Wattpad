    <br> <font size="5"> There was once a lesbian who lover her girlfriend very much. Nobody knows that they are couple except for her friends. She doesn't know that before their anniversary, her girlfriend is destined to die because  of heart disease. </br>

    <br> Her girlfriend doesn't talk about it 'cause she doesn't want her to be depressed or worry about her condition. </br>

    <br> One day, her girlfriend asked her, <i> "How much do you love me?" </i> </br>

    <br> The lesbian smiled and said, <i> "I really love you very much to the point that I can't live without you" </i> </br>

    <br> Her girlfriend asked again, <i> "Then what if one day, Im going to leave you? " </i> </br>

    <br> She answered, <i> "If you're going to leave me, don't say goodbye" </i> </br>

    <br> Her girlfriend looked at her eyes and asked,<i> "Why?" </i> </br>

    <br> She hugged her so tight and said ... </br>

    <br> <b> To bear in my mind that I'll be still here waiting for you even though I already know the fact that you're  not going to come back anymore .. </b></br></font>
